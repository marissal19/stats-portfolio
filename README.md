# Applied Regression and Time Series Modeling
Projects conducted during the Fall 2024 semester utilizing time series analysis, ANOVA modeling, and multiple linear regression concepts. 

* Wrote ```R``` Scripts on ```Markdown``` to explore relationships in the behavior of particulate matter 2.5 across Texas through building three major models: Time Series Model, One-Way ANOVA Model, Multiple Linear Regression Model.
* Moving from the Rio Grande Valley, an area rich in citrus agriculture, to an urban city, like Austin, sparked an interest in the effects of land use and poverty on pollution levels.
* Goals: Better understand the environment and how human interventions shape our ecosystems. 

### Documents 
* There are **model_type** ```.pdf``` files that walk the reader through the process of building the respective model. Each model tackles a different problem based on the model parameters and model assumptions.
* Each file begins with an **Executive Summary** section followed by an **Introduction**, which explain the summary information of the model's fit and gives context to the problem being tackled.
* Each document shows the process for data wrangling, model construction, and model assessment.
* Concluding each file, there is an ```R appendix``` - demonstrating the code to produce these results.
